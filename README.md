(DEPRECATED)

This was an old app to to showcase the use of the [simple_token_authentication gem](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication).

A new way of authenticating an app using a simple token is available [here](https://github.com/dnlserrano/token_auth_sample_app).

I have since found that the problem this gem tries to solve is [too simple to justify a gem of its own](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication/issues/94#issuecomment-104444363).
I implemented an alternative "gem-free" version of token authentication in [another repo](https://github.com/dnlserrano/token_auth_sample_app).
I favor this solution and recommend everyone to take a look at it as opposed to jumping right in to using the aforementioned gem.
